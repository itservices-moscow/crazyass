                      <p>To create an account with CRAZY ASS, you must be 18 years of age or older. Link your payment
                        details with a verification payment, this is to prevent fraud and you give your consent for the
                        monthly direct debit. No money is deducted during the trial period.
                        The trial period starts after you have completed your registration, you will receive a
                        confirmation e-mail with all the information you need. Didn’t receive an e-mail? Make sure you
                        have used the correct e-mail address and also check your spam box. Otherwise you will miss out
                        on important information about your membership.
                      </p>
                      <p>The first pair of boxer shorts are delivered within 7 working days. This gives you enough time
                        to try them. Do you not want to remain a member after these 7 days? Then you can cancel your
                        membership immediately during the trial period, without any obligations. You can keep the first
                        pair of boxer shorts. Staying with us after the trial period? Then your membership starts.
                        Congratulations! You will now receive a new pair of boxer shorts each month.</p>
                      <p>We have a brand new design every month and you will receive this design in your letterbox.
                        Therefore you cannot choose the design or colour of the monthly boxer shorts. If you have
                        multiple memberships, you will monthly receive several boxer shorts with the design of the
                        month.</p>
                      <p>Once the trial period is over, your membership becomes active and the monthly payments start.
                        They are every month around the 27th. Your boxer shorts are delivered the month after between
                        the 17th and the 23rd. Men’s boxer shorts cost $10.99 per month. In the membership you pay the
                        month in advance and your membership can be easily cancelled monthly.</p>

                        have to make any effort to send the wrong or defective pair back. You may throw away a damaged
                        product. You can keep the wrong product, or give it to someone else. That saves you a trip to
                        the post box :) </p>

                      <p>In your account, under <b>'Memberships'</b>, you will see a slider to immediately pause your

                      <p>If you do this <b>before the 25th</b> of the month, your break starts immediately. If you do it
                        between the 25th of the month and the last day of the month, the next payment and order of the
                        month have already been prepared in your account, so your break will start directly after that.
                      </p>
                      <p>Or pause in the following way via your account:</p>

                        pausing via the menu. You will immediately receive a pause confirmation email. Once your pause

                      <p>The prints of the Originals boxer shorts are printed on white fabric. Despite the best printing
                        techniques, the colours can fade slightly. Sometimes this is just a little for the first few
                        washes and then remains the same. </p>
                      <p>We know our boxer shorts best. Wash the boxer shorts at 30 degrees, do not use a tumble dryer
                        and no fabric softener. CRAZY ASS boxer shorts consist of 95% cotton and 5% elastane. Cotton
                        tends to shrink and fade in colour at high temperatures. Also, the elastic in the fabric and of
                        the waistband will wear out faster. We recommend using a good colour detergent for optimal
                        colour retention.</p>

                      shorts. That's how confident we are!</p>
                    <p>To create an account with CRAZY ASS, you must be 18 years of age or older. Link your payment
                      details with a verification payment, this is to prevent fraud and you give your consent for the
                      monthly direct debit. No money is deducted during the trial period.
                      The trial period starts after you have completed your registration, you will receive a
                      confirmation e-mail with all the information you need. Didn’t receive an e-mail? Make sure you
                      have used the correct e-mail address and also check your spam box. Otherwise you will miss out on
                      important information about your membership.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first pair of boxer shorts are delivered within 7 working days. This gives you enough time to
                      try them. Do you not want to remain a member after these 7 days? Then you can cancel your
                      membership immediately during the trial period, without any obligations. You can keep the first
                      pair of boxer shorts. Staying with us after the trial period? Then your membership starts.
                      Congratulations! You will now receive a new pair of boxer shorts each month.</p>
                    <p>We have a brand new design every month and you will receive this design in your letterbox.
                      Therefore you cannot choose the design or colour of the monthly boxer shorts. If you have multiple
                      memberships, you will monthly receive several boxer shorts with the design of the month.</p>
                    <p>Once the trial period is over, your membership becomes active and the monthly payments start.
                      They are every month around the 27th. Your boxer shorts are delivered the month after between the
                      17th and the 23rd. Men’s boxer shorts cost $10.99 per month. In the membership you pay the month
                      in advance and your membership can be easily cancelled monthly.</p>

                    <p>If it is still closed and in good condition (for example due to a wrong size) you may give it

                      ASS. Then you can make them happy and also help us a little. Of course, you can also keep it

                    <p>If you do this <b>before the 25th</b> of the month, your break starts immediately. If you do it
                      between the 25th of the month and the last day of the month, the next payment and order of the
                      month have already been prepared in your account, so your break will start directly after that.
                    </p>
                    <p>Or pause in the following way via your account:</p>

                    <p>After the trial period or in an active or extra membership, a notice period also applies to
                      pausing via the menu. You will immediately receive a pause confirmation email. Once your pause
                      ends, your membership will automatically restart.</p>

                      cancel between the 25th and last day of the month, you make two more payments. One that month, and

                    <p>The prints of the Originals boxer shorts are printed on white fabric. Despite the best printing
                      techniques, the colours can fade slightly. Sometimes this is just a little for the first few
                      washes and then remains the same. </p>
                    <p>We know our boxer shorts best. Wash the boxer shorts at 30 degrees, do not use a tumble dryer and
                      no fabric softener. CRAZY ASS boxer shorts consist of 95% cotton and 5% elastane. Cotton tends to
                      shrink and fade in colour at high temperatures. Also, the elastic in the fabric and of the
                      waistband will wear out faster. We recommend using a good colour detergent for optimal colour
                      retention.</p>
